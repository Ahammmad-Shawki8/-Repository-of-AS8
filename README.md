# _Python is the best language to start for beginners_

In this repository, I have added Python basics code which will be helpful for beginners who are new to programming as well as programmers of different language. 
Lots of basics topics has been covered with sufficient examples. After studying this repository, coders will have a proper knowledge about coding in Python. 
After that, they can move to any separate field of programming. It can be Data Science, Software Engineering, Web Development, Game Development, System Development etc.
