# advanced python

# what is advanced python?
# it means python spreading its wings across multiple dimentions and use-cases in many fields.
# python is really a powerful oop language. it can be used in many advanced concepts too.
# some advanced concepts are-
    # 1. sys programming
    # 2. graph theory
    # 3. mathematics
    # 4. computer science
    # 5. numerical computation
    # 6. databases

# General Intro:

# sys programming:
    # it is programming for system based softwares. 
    # it deals the programming that is often part of the operating system.
    # in this module, we will learn pip, threads, folks and so on about system programming

# Graph theory:
    # it works with models like pygraph and networkX and all of thats use to implement 
    # a graph class with essential functionality for graph creation, manipulation and calculation.

# mathematics:
    # we can check out how to work with polynomials.
    # and how easily and beutifully a class is presented 
    # for the creation and manipulation of polynomial functions that can be returned in python

# computer science:
    # advanced concepts of computer science go through all the concepts like
    # finance state machine, turing machine and even text classification with nym pys and all the concepts like this.

# numerical computation:
    # if we want to get faster and efficient results with arrays and matrices or so
    # then the numpy module of python is definately the right tool.
    # module matplotlib is all we need to plot data in different way.
    # also a introduction with linear combination is a good start for this advanvced concept.

# databases:
    # it is pretty simple and straight forward.
    # it is basically how python works with different database management software like mysql or postgresql.
